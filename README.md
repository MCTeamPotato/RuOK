RuOK is a straightforward optimization mod that provides simple yet practical client-side optimizations along with a suite of features and fixes.
Are you ok? (。・∀・)ノ = RuOK?

# Features
1. **Rendering Optimization**: This mod reduces the load on your computer by limiting the number of entities rendered within a specified range and dynamically adjusting the rendering position of entities based on the player's location. This means smoother gameplay in areas with more entities.
2. **Global Graphics Settings Adjustment**: Select from Ultra High, High, Normal, Low, or Very Low to instantly adjust your graphics quality, view distance, and more, without the need for manual tweaking of individual settings.
3. **Quick Toggle for Mob Rendering**: Configure which mobs to render via the GUI, eliminating the need to manually edit configuration files and restart the game.
4. **A Series of Minor Features**: Download this mod to discover more features!

# Actual Effects
In a large Skyblock pack, players rapidly right-click on dirt to obtain a large number of gravel. The optimization is noticeable, with frame rates stabilizing from an unrestricted 14 FPS to a smooth 52 FPS.
